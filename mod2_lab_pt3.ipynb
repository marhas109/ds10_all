    "\n",
    "- Compares parameter efficiency between CNNs and fully-connected networks using a specific image size example\n",
    "- Explains how parameter sharing and local connectivity in CNNs address the limitations of fully-connected networks\n",
    "- Describes how CNNs maintain spatial information that would be lost in traditional neural networks\n",
    "- Illustrates a specific problem where a fully-connected network would struggle but a CNN would excel, with reasoning."

    "### Mark's Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs were specifically developed for image classification and there are a number of built-in characteristics that make them better for these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of how CNNs work is their kernels. The kernels are essentially filters, each of which scan the entire image when called. This significantly reduces the number of parameters in a CNN model vs. a traditional neural network. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine we need to process an image that is 256 x 256 pixels using the RGB color schema.\n",
    "- A traditional, fully-connected network with 250 neurons would have:\n",
    "    - 196,608 inputs (256 x 256 x 3)\n",
    "    - 250 outputs \n",
    "    - 49,152,250 parameters (196,608 x 250 + 250)\n",
    "- A CNN with 10 5x5 filters would have:\n",
    "    - 5: height/width of each filter \n",
    "    - 3: input channels\n",
    "    - 10: total filters\n",
    "    - 760: total parameters ((5 x 5 x 3) x 10) +10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter Sharing and Local Connectivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "A traditional neural network makes extensive use of fully connected layers, where all neurons in one layer are connected to every neuron in the next layer. This architecture has the benefit of significant information processing capabilities and is powerful when used in certain settings. However, fully connected layers require a large number of parameters: every connection between individual neurons requires its own weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons in CNNs, on the other hand, are only connected to a local region of the previous layer. Weights are shared within each local cluster, significantly reducing the number of parameters in a CNN model. This makes CNNs easier to configure and manage, and significantly reduces the computing resources CNNs use compared to traditional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensitivity to Local Variations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filters of a CNN scans across the entire target image, and the feature maps that the model outputs in its early layers contain information about where in the image each feature is located. Although deeper layers contain less location information (instead working on object parts and whole objects), the CNN model overall contains positional information about the features it extracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional neural networks, on the other hand, typically do not preserve spatial information. Instead, they flatten input data into vectors, omitting information about which pixels were adjacent to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparing CNNs and Traditional Models with an Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we were asked to process a 500 x 500 color image of 3 people. One of the people in the image is shown in profile, for another we can only see their head, and for the third, we can see their whole body front-on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we processed this image with a traditional neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each color within each pixel would be its own input, and each neuron would need its own weight\n",
    "    - We'd quickly end up with millions of parameters to manage, which would require significant computing resources to manage\n",
    "2. Each feature would need to be extracted and provided as an input\n",
    "    - If we wanted to identify faces, those would need to be individually identified and set as an input\n",
    "    - We may also need to identify subcategories of faces (face only, face attached to a body, etc.)\n",
    "3. We'd need to carefully manage features to try to avoid overfitting/the curse of dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we processed this image with a CNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The width, height, and depth of each neuron over the 3 colors would be our inputs\n",
    "    - Since each neuron is connected only to a local region of the previous layer, each cluster shares parameters\n",
    "    - The parameter total for the CNN model would number in the hundreds to thousands\n",
    "2. The CNN would automatically learn features as each layer processed the image, so no feature engineering would be needed\n",
    "3. While overfitting is still a risk in the CNN model, its significantly fewer number of features makes this less likely\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the numbered items above, the CNN is a superior model: it is less complex and computationally intensive, it automates feature engineering, and it is less likely to overfit the data."
